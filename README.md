## 👩🏽‍🔬 About the Researcher

Hello! I'm **Juliet Nkwor**, an independent researcher passionate about embedded systems and IoT.  
The future of embedded systems lies in the Internet of Things, where intelligent, connected devices shape smarter environments - from agriculture to healthcare and beyond.

My journey began with a **BSc in Physics with Electronics** from *Osun State University, Nigeria*,  
and later an **MSc in Electronics and Computer Engineering** from *the University of Birmingham, UK*.  

Through these experiences and multiple prototype projects, I developed a deep interest not just in *building* things,  
but in *understanding the underlying principles* that make them work efficiently and sustainably.
