# 👋 Welcome to OpenIoTResearch  
**Exploring Embedded Systems and IoT for Real-World Impact**

Hello! I’m **Juliet Nkwor**, an independent researcher passionate about the intersection of **embedded systems** and the **Internet of Things (IoT)** - technologies that are transforming automation, sustainability, and intelligent systems.

I began my academic journey studying **Physics with Electronics** at *Osun State University, Nigeria*, where I developed a strong interest in the science behind modern electronics. Later, I completed my **M.Sc. in Electronics and Computer Engineering** at the *University of Birmingham, UK*, where hands-on experience with hardware prototypes deepened my curiosity about IoT-driven innovation.

## 🌱 Research Focus

My research explores **Embedded Systems** and **IoT-based automation** for real-world applications such as:

- 🌾 Smart Agriculture  
- 🌍 Environmental Monitoring  
- ⚡ Energy Efficiency  
- 🤖 AI-Powered Automation  

I believe that impactful research comes not only from *building systems*, but from *understanding why and how* they work at a fundamental level.

> “I don’t just want to build devices - I want to understand their design, logic, and impact.  
> Research for me is not just invention, but comprehension.”
