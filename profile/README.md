👋 Welcome to OpenIoTResearch
Exploring Embedded Systems and IoT for Real-World Impact

Hello! I’m an independent researcher passionate about the intersection of embedded systems and the Internet of Things (IoT) — technologies that are shaping the future of automation, sustainability, and intelligent systems.

I began my academic journey studying Physics with Electronics at Osun State University, Nigeria, where I developed a deep interest in the science behind modern electronics. Later, I pursued a Master’s degree in Electronics and Computer Engineering at the University of Birmingham, UK, where my hands-on experience with hardware prototypes strengthened my curiosity for embedded systems and IoT-driven innovation.

🌱 My Research Focus

My work revolves around Embedded Systems, IoT-based automation, and their applications in fields like smart agriculture, environmental monitoring, and energy efficiency.
I believe that understanding not just how to build systems but also why and how they work at a fundamental level is what makes research truly impactful.

The Smart Agriculture IoT Project is a step toward building affordable, scalable, and open-source IoT systems for improving farming practices, data collection, and sustainability in resource-limited environments.

🤝 Collaboration & Research Opportunities

I am open to collaboration with researchers, developers, and institutions working on related areas.
My long-term goal is to pursue a Ph.D. in Embedded Systems and IoT — deepening my understanding and contributing to open, sustainable innovation in this field.

If you’re a researcher, academic institution, or tech innovator interested in collaboration, feel free to connect or open a discussion on GitHub.

💬 Personal Note

“I don’t just want to build devices — I want to understand their design, logic, and impact.
Research for me is not just invention, but comprehension.”
